1.  To comment C++ code:

    Inserting "//" will identify everything after this symbol as a comment on a single line.  To add a block comment that can span
    multiple lines, insert the desired comment between the asterisks of the "/* */" symbol.
    
2.  To comment Python code:

    The "#" symbol is used to comment out a single line.  To identify a block of code as a comment, insert the code between three
    double quotation marks, literally: """comment""".
    
3.  What kind of file has extension ".md"?

    Markdown files have extension ".md".  Markdown languages control the styling of webpages and other computer interfaces using
    plain text.  The primary example of a markdown language is HTML.
